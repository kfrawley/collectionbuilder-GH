            <p>In the spring of 1672, Italian noblewoman Marie Mancini discovered that her husband, the preeminant Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna, intended to poison her. To escape, she fled Rome with her sister, Hortense, to France where the two hoped to win the protection of King Louis XIV (Marie's former lover), which would allow them to live independently from their husbands.</p>
            <p>But the king did not welcome them to court, and the two were forced to devise other means of living independently.</p>
            <p>Marie's letters to her estranged husband and her friends from this time describe her struggles, triumphs, and emotions as she navigated her new freedom.</p>
